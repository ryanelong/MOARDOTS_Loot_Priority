# MOAR DOTS Loot Priority Tooltip

This is a WoW Classic Addon for use by the Guild MOAR DOTS on the Kirtonos-US Server.
  
Adds guild class/spec raid loot priority to in-game item tooltip. 

This addon adds MD loot prio to item tooltip for loot that have priority on it, so you can access guild raid loot information while ingame.

By using this addon everyone is able to check loot prio just by looking at the tooltip when loot drops.

The addon is mandatory for Master Looter in order to distribute loot correctly during raids.

It will say the priority if there is any, for example:
Bracers of Arcane Accuracy from Broodlord Lashlayer: "MD loot prio: Warlock = Mage > SPriest"

This means mages and warlocks have priority and would roll equally over Shadow priests.
